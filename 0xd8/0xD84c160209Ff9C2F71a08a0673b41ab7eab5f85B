/**
 * @title AssetVault
 * @author Non-Fungible Technologies, Inc.
 *
 * The Asset Vault is a vault for the storage of collateralized assets.
 * Designed for one-time use, like a piggy bank. Once withdrawals are enabled,
 * and the bank is broken, the vault can no longer be used or transferred.
 *
 * It starts in a deposit-only state. Funds cannot be withdrawn at this point. When
 * the owner calls "enableWithdraw()", the state is set to a withdrawEnabled state.
 * Withdraws cannot be disabled once enabled. This restriction protects integrations
 * and purchasers of AssetVaults from unexpected withdrawal and frontrunning attacks.
 * For example: someone buys an AV assuming it contains token X, but I withdraw token X
 * immediately before the sale concludes.
 *
 * @dev Asset Vaults support arbitrary external calls by either:
 *     - the current owner of the vault
 *     - someone who the current owner "delegates" through the ICallDelegator interface
 *
 * This is to enable airdrop claims by borrowers during loans and other forms of NFT utility.
 * In practice, LoanCore delegates to the borrower during the period of an open loan.
 * Arcade.xyz maintains an allowed and restricted list of calls to balance between utility and security.
