/**
    @title  Crowd Funded HyPC Pool V2
    @author Barry Rowe, David Liendo
    @notice This contract allows users to pool their HyPC together to swap for c_HyPC (containerized HyPC) that
            can be used to back a license in the HyperCycle ecosystem. Unlike HyPC, which is an ERC20, c_HyPC
            is a ERC721, with each token corresponding to 2^19 = 524,288 HyPC, and can have a string assigned
            to it via its contract. These c_HyPC can be obtained by using the swap contract to deposit 524,288
            HyPC for 1 c_HyPC, and can be redeemed for the deposited HyPC again using the same swap contract.

            Since swapping HyPC for c_HyPC requires a lot of funds, a pooling contract is useful for users 
            wanting to have c_HyPC back their license (via the assignment string). In this case, a license 
            holder can create a proposal in the pool for 1 c_HyPC to back their license. They put up some 
            backing HyPC as collateral for this loan, that will be used as interest payments for the users
            that provide HyPC for the proposal. Unlike in V1 of this pool contract, a license holder can
            create a proposal for multiple c_HyPC instead just one.

            As an example, a manager wants to borrow a c_HyPC for 18 months (78 weeks). The manager puts up 
            50,000 HyPC as collateral to act as interest for the user that deposit to this proposal. This means
            that the yearly APR for a depositor to the proposal will be: 50,000/524,288 * (26/39) = 0.063578288
            or roughly 6.35% (26 being the number of 2 week periods in a year, and 39 the number of 2 week
            periods in the proposal's term). The depositors can then claim this interest every period (2 weeks) 
            until the end of the proposal, at which point they can then withdraw and get back their initial 
            deposit. While the proposal is active, the c_HyPC is held by the pool contract itself, though the 
            manager that created the proposal can change the assignement of the swapped for c_HyPC.

            All amounts of HyPC follow the token's native 6 decimals of percision. Dimensionless amounts,
            like that of the APR calcuation, are also held to 6 decimals of percision. General units are
            as follows:

            HyPC = 6 decimals, (eg: 1.2 HyPC = 1,200,000)
            timestamps = 0 decimals, seconds (eg: startTime = block.timestamp)
            periods = 0 decimals, 2 weeks (ie: 1 period = 2*7*24*60*60 seconds, 18 months = 34 periods)
            interestRate = 6 decimals, dimensionless ( 10% = 100,000 )
