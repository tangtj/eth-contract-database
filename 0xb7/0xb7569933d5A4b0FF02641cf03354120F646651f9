Welcome to Ether Doge - the only safe tribute to the King.

Introduction
---------------------

EtherDoge (EDOGE) is a token that was first deployed in October 2017 and is 
considered to be the first ever meme coin to be launched on Ethereum. The first!

Recently, some groups and individuals (KOL's, call channels, etc) have attempted to 
resurrect the original EDOGE by buying what remains of its available supply then 
promoting it.

However, the distribution of that old token is poor and uncertain. This is partly 
due to recent opportunists predicting its resurrection, so they bought before 
kickstarting the hype, volume returned, and now they're dumping and / or waiting to 
dump on newcomers.

The other aspect is that contract is not renounced, plus the current owner can 
actually mint additional tokens, which is a significant danger.

So in terms of the safety aspects concerning the original token, as Elon (the Doge 
master) so eloquently said, "Go fu*k yourself".

Due to this highly undesirable situation it quickly became clear that a clean, 
holder friendly, safe and resprectful version needed to be created, and this is it.

No tax, no limitations (other than a time based 0.5% max wallet to ensure balanced 
and fair distribution), completely safe and transperent. As it should be.

Tokenomics
---------------------

100% tax free. No initial tax, no contract clog, nothing. Same as SHIB.

Supply: 1,000,000,000 (one billion) - now we have a chance to hit $1 per token.

99.5% of the total supply + 0.5 ETH added to initial liquidity.

0.5% of the total supply airdropped to myself, "the developer", as payment.

Max wallet: 0.5% of the total supply (auto lifts after 7 days from launch).

LP tokens: 100% burned to the DEAD address (immutable).

No blacklist or whitelist. Immediately renounced. Fully decentralized. 100% safe.

Socials
---------------------

Any Telegram group, X account, website, etc, will need to be created by whomever 
feels up to the task. DOGE, SHIB, PEPE, and all those other financially rewarding, 
eye-watering mooners demonstrated what can be achieved through the spirit of a 
naturally-formed, ever-expanding, dedicated community. Imagine the possibilities 
now that the narrative surrounds the first ever meme coin to be launched on 
Ethereum (the grandaddy of blockchains).

To kick things off, here's an Ether Doge logo that can be used for the Telegram 
group / X profile image if desired:

Finally
---------------------

We're all tired of scams, farms, two-faced shillers, et al. So let's make this a 
genuine, explosive community token to remember, one that'll flourish and remain 
strong moving into 2024.

As for my identity, it may be cliche to state but it's really not important. Call me 
0xSafu, Ser Safu, Teh Safu, or even Tim if you like.

Good luck, happy forthcoming holidays, and may the DEX be with you, always.
