/// @title Consensus interface
///
/// @notice This contract defines a generic interface for consensuses.
/// We use the word "consensus" to designate a contract that provides claims
/// in the base layer regarding the state of off-chain machines running in
/// the execution layer. How this contract is able to reach consensus, who is
/// able to submit claims, and how are claims stored in the base layer are
/// some of the implementation details left unspecified by this interface.
///
/// From the point of view of a DApp, these claims are necessary to validate
/// on-chain action allowed by the off-chain machine in the form of vouchers
/// and notices. Each claim is composed of three parts: an epoch hash, a first
/// index, and a last index. We'll explain each of these parts below.
///
/// First, let us define the word "epoch". For finality reasons, we need to
/// divide the stream of inputs being fed into the off-chain machine into
/// batches of inputs, which we call "epoches". At the end of every epoch,
/// we summarize the state of the off-chain machine in a single hash, called
/// "epoch hash". Please note that this interface does not define how this
/// stream of inputs is being chopped up into epoches.
///
/// The other two parts are simply the indices of the first and last inputs
/// accepted during the epoch. Logically, the first index MUST BE less than
/// or equal to the last index. As a result, every epoch MUST accept at least
/// one input. This assumption stems from the fact that the state of a machine
/// can only change after an input is fed into it.
///
/// Examples of possible implementations of this interface include:
///
/// * An authority consensus, controlled by a single address who has full
///   control over epoch boundaries, claim submission, asset management, etc.
///
/// * A quorum consensus, controlled by a limited set of validators, that
///   vote on the state of the machine at the end of every epoch. Also, epoch
///   boundaries are determined by the timestamp in the base layer, and assets
///   are split equally amongst the validators.
///
/// * An NxN consensus, which allows anyone to submit and dispute claims
///   in the base layer. Epoch boundaries are determined in the same fashion
///   as in the quorum example.
