/// @title EtherEthos (v2.0.2) - offered 'as-is', without warranty, and disclaiming liability for damages resulting from using the contract or data stored on it.
/// @author Matto AKA MonkMatto. More info: matto.xyz.
/// @notice EtherEthos is a hyperstructure that facilitates the creation of a composable EtherEthos (profile) for Ethereum addresses.
/// It empowers users to:
/// - Share links and associated accounts.
/// - Share social proofs by publicly respecting other accounts. 
/// - Write notes for other accounts (requires the recipient to respect the note writer).
/// - Store personal account details such as an alias, a description, preferred website / social media / gallery link, and a preferred NFT to use as a PFP.
/// Users should refrain from submitting Personally Identifying Information (PII) - this is the realm of crypto.
/// @notice User Responsibilities and Data Accessibility
/// - Users are responsible for the data they provide, including text descriptions, URLs, and smart contracts.
/// - By storing data in this contract, the submitted text-data becomes publicly accessible and may be used in smart contract composition.
/// - Opting-out by toggling an account's composable value to false disables most data-returning functions.
/// - However, due to the public nature of the data and immutability of the blockchain, 'opt-outs' cannot be guaranteed to be respected by third-party developers.
/// @notice Composability and Developer Responsibilities
/// - This contract encourages developers to compose with EtherEthos's data, including into tokens, in a responsible manner respecting users' 'opt-out' requests (disabled composability).
/// - Contracts aiming to compose with this contract's data must adhere to using the assemble* functions to retrieve data.
/// @dev Account Delegation and Security
/// - This contract supports account delegation, allowing authorized accounts to add or modify details on behalf of other accounts.
/// - The delegateContract variable stores the address of the Delegate contract responsible for validating delegations.
/// - The checkDelegateForContract function in the Delegate contract is called to verify if an account is authorized to act on behalf of another account.
/// - Account owners should carefully consider the implications of granting delegation permissions to other accounts.
/// @dev Moderation Features
/// - Limited moderation features are supported, allowing authorized accounts to toggle an account's composability, and to block/unblock accounts from writing to the contract.
/// - The allModerators array stores the addresses of all moderator accounts.
/// - The toggleModerator function can be called by the contract owner to grant or revoke moderator permissions.
/// @custom:experimental Warning Experimental Contract
/// - This contract is experimental, and no guarantees are made regarding its functionality, security, or lifespan.
/// - If a new version is deployed, it may not be backwards compatible.
/// - Users and developers should exercise caution when interacting with this contract and understand the potential risks involved.
/// @custom:security-contact For any security concerns, please reach out to monkmatto@protonmail.com.
/// @custom:legal-disclaimer
/// 1. Users are solely responsible for the data they provide, including text descriptions, URLs, and smart contracts. Submission of illegal, malicious, or harmful data is strictly prohibited.
/// 2. Matto, EtherEthos, Substratum, and all associated entities disclaim all liability for any damages resulting from the use or misuse of data provided by users.
/// 3. EtherEthos does not have control over user-submitted content, nor provides any guarantee on the safety or reliability of any data, including links to third-party websites or contracts.
/// 4. The use of any data, links, or contracts stored within this contract and presented by frontend applications is entirely at the end-user's risk.
/// 5. The act of composing data from this contract into tokens, other contracts, or digital assets lies solely at the discretion and risk of the user and/or contract developer.
/// 6. Such composability carries risks and implications, which may include but are not limited to data permanence, security issues, social costs, and legal considerations. By accessing this contract, users and developers, certify they have considered the potential risks and accept all risks and implications both foreseeable and unforeseeable at the time of use.
/// @notice Legal Variable
/// - If present, the data stored in this contract's 'legal' variable supersedes the above legal disclaimers.
/// - In the event of conflicting terms, the conditions outlined in the 'legal' variable take precedence.
