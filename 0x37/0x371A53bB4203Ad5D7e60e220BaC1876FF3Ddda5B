/**
 * @title Auth Module
 *
 * @dev The `Auth` contract module provides a basic access control mechanism,
 *      where a set of addresses are granted access to protected functions.
 *      These addresses are said to be _auth'ed_.
 *
 *      Initially, the address given as constructor argument is the only address
 *      auth'ed. Through the `rely(address)` and `deny(address)` functions,
 *      auth'ed callers are able to grant/renounce auth to/from addresses.
 *
 *      This module is used through inheritance. It will make available the
 *      modifier `auth`, which can be applied to functions to restrict their
 *      use to only auth'ed callers.
