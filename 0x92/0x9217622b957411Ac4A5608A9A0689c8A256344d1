/**
 * @dev Interface of the ERC20 Permit extension allowing approvals to be made via signatures, as defined in
 * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612[EIP-2612].
 *
 * Adds the {permit} method, which can be used to change an account's ERC20 allowance (see {IERC20-allowance}) by
 * presenting a message signed by the account. By not relying on {IERC20-approve}, the token holder account doesn't
 * need to send a transaction, and thus is not required to hold Ether at all.
 *
 * ==== Security Considerations
 *
 * There are two important considerations concerning the use of `permit`. The first is that a valid permit signature
 * expresses an allowance, and it should not be assumed to convey additional meaning. In particular, it should not be
 * considered as an intention to spend the allowance in any specific way. The second is that because permits have
 * built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun. A protocol that uses permits should
 * take this into consideration and allow a `permit` call to fail. Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be
 * generally recommended is:
 *
 * ```solidity
 * function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {
 *     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}
 *     doThing(..., value);
 * }
 *
 * function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {
 *     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);
 *     ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of
 * `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also
 * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).
 *
 * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so
 * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.
 */

/**
 * @notice Adapted Uniswap V3 OracleLibrary computation to be compliant with Solidity 0.8.x and later.
 *
 * Documentation for Auditors:
 *
 * Solidity Version: Updated the Solidity version pragma to ^0.8.0. This change ensures compatibility
 * with Solidity version 0.8.x.
 *
 * Safe Arithmetic Operations: Solidity 0.8.x automatically checks for arithmetic overflows/underflows.
 * Therefore, the code no longer needs to use SafeMath library (or similar) for basic arithmetic operations.
 * This change simplifies the code and reduces the potential for errors related to manual overflow/underflow checking.
 *
 * Overflow/Underflow: With the introduction of automatic overflow/underflow checks in Solidity 0.8.x, the code is inherently
 * safer and less prone to certain types of arithmetic errors.
 *
 * Removal of SafeMath Library: Since Solidity 0.8.x handles arithmetic operations safely, the use of SafeMath library
 * is omitted in this update.
 *
 * Git-style diff for the `consult` function:
 *
 * ```diff
 * function consult(address pool, uint32 secondsAgo)
 *     internal
 *     view

 * @notice Adapted Uniswap V3 pool address computation to be compliant with Solidity 0.8.x and later.
 * @dev Changes were made to address the stricter type conversion rules in newer Solidity versions.
 *      Original Uniswap V3 code directly converted a uint256 to an address, which is disallowed in Solidity 0.8.x.
 *      Adaptation Steps:
 *        1. The `pool` address is computed by first hashing pool parameters.
 *        2. The resulting `uint256` hash is then explicitly cast to `uint160` before casting to `address`.
 *           This two-step conversion process is necessary due to the Solidity 0.8.x restriction.
 *           Direct conversion from `uint256` to `address` is disallowed to prevent mistakes
 *           that can occur due to the size mismatch between the types.
 *        3. Added a require statement to ensure `token0` is less than `token1`, maintaining
 *           Uniswap's invariant and preventing pool address calculation errors.
 * @param factory The Uniswap V3 factory contract address.
 * @param key The PoolKey containing token addresses and fee tier.
 * @return pool The computed address of the Uniswap V3 pool.
 * @custom:modification Explicit type conversion from `uint256` to `uint160` then to `address`.

/**
 * @notice Adapted Uniswap V3 TickMath library computation to be compliant with Solidity 0.8.x and later.
 *
 * Documentation for Auditors:
 *
 * Solidity Version: Updated the Solidity version pragma to ^0.8.0. This change ensures compatibility
 * with Solidity version 0.8.x.
 *
 * Safe Arithmetic Operations: Solidity 0.8.x automatically checks for arithmetic overflows/underflows.
 * Therefore, the code no longer needs to use the SafeMath library (or similar) for basic arithmetic operations.
 * This change simplifies the code and reduces the potential for errors related to manual overflow/underflow checking.
 *
 * Explicit Type Conversion: The explicit conversion of `MAX_TICK` from `int24` to `uint256` in the `require` statement
 * is safe and necessary for comparison with `absTick`, which is a `uint256`. This conversion is compliant with
 * Solidity 0.8.x's type system and does not introduce any arithmetic risk.
 *
 * Overflow/Underflow: With the introduction of automatic overflow/underflow checks in Solidity 0.8.x, the code is inherently
 * safer and less prone to certain types of arithmetic errors.
 *
 * Removal of SafeMath Library: Since Solidity 0.8.x handles arithmetic operations safely, the use of the SafeMath library
 * is omitted in this update.
 *
 * Git-style diff for the TickMath library:
 *
 * ```diff
 * - pragma solidity >=0.5.0 <0.8.0;
 * + pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
 *
 *   function getSqrtRatioAtTick(int24 tick) internal pure returns (uint160 sqrtPriceX96) {
 *       uint256 absTick = tick < 0 ? uint256(-int256(tick)) : uint256(int256(tick));
 * -     require(absTick <= uint256(MAX_TICK), 'T');
 * +     require(absTick <= uint256(int256(MAX_TICK)), 'T'); // Explicit type conversion for Solidity 0.8.x compatibility
 *       // ... (rest of the function)
 *   }
 *
 * function getTickAtSqrtRatio(
 *     uint160 sqrtPriceX96
 * ) internal pure returns (int24 tick) {
 *     // [Code for calculating the tick based on sqrtPriceX96 remains unchanged]
 *
 * -   tick = tickLow == tickHi
 * -       ? tickLow
 * -       : getSqrtRatioAtTick(tickHi) <= sqrtPriceX96
 * -       ? tickHi
 * -       : tickLow;
 * +   if (tickLow == tickHi) {
 * +       tick = tickLow;
 * +   } else {
 * +       tick = (getSqrtRatioAtTick(tickHi) <= sqrtPriceX96) ? tickHi : tickLow;
 * +   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Note: Other than the pragma version change and the explicit type conversion in the `require` statement, the original functions
 * within the TickMath library are compatible with Solidity 0.8.x without requiring any further modifications. This is due to
 * the fact that the logic within these functions already adheres to safe arithmetic practices and does not involve operations
 * that would be affected by the 0.8.x compiler's built-in checks.

     *           for the arithmetic mean tick for the calculated period.
     *        4. Convert the arithmetic mean tick to the square root price (sqrtPriceX96) and calculate the price
