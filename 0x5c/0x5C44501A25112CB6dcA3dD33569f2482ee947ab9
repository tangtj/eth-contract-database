     * @notice  defines requirements to send or receive tokens for non-TRANSFERER_ROLE. If zero, everbody can transfer the token. If non-zero, then only those who have met the requirements can send or receive tokens.
     *     Requirements can be defined by the REQUIREMENT_ROLE, and are validated against the allowList. They can include things like "must have a verified email address", "must have a verified phone number", "must have a verified identity", etc.
     *     Also, tiers from 0 to four can be used.
     * @dev Requirements are defined as bit mask, with the bit position encoding it's meaning and the bit's value whether this requirement will be enforced.
     *     Example:
     *     - position 0: 1 = must be KYCed (0 = no KYC required)
     *     - position 1: 1 = must be american citizen (0 = american citizenship not required)
     *     - position 2: 1 = must be a penguin (0 = penguin status not required)
     *     These meanings are not defined within code, neither in the token contract nor the allowList. Nevertheless, the definition used by the people responsible for both contracts MUST match,
     *     or the token contract will not work as expected. E.g. if the allowList defines position 2 as "is a penguin", while the token contract uses position 2 as "is a hedgehog", then the tokens
     *     might be sold to hedgehogs, which was never the intention.
     *     Here some examples of how requirements can be used in practice:
     *     With requirements 0b0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000101, only KYCed penguins will be allowed to send or receive tokens.
     *     With requirements 0b0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000111, only KYCed american penguins will be allowed to send or receive tokens.
     *     With requirements 0b0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000, even french hedgehogs will be allowed to send or receive tokens.
     *
     *     The highest four bits are defined as tiers as follows:
     *     - 0b0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 = tier 0 is required
     *     - 0b0001000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 = tier 1 is required
     *     - 0b0010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 = tier 2 is required
     *     - 0b0100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 = tier 3 is required
     *     - 0b1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 = tier 4 is required

 *
 * Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed

 * using `public constant` hash digests:
 *
 * ```solidity

 * that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other
 * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using
 * {_setRoleAdmin}.
 *

/**
 * @dev This contract extends an ERC20 token with a snapshot mechanism. When a snapshot is created, the balances and
 * total supply at the time are recorded for later access.
 *
 * This can be used to safely create mechanisms based on token balances such as trustless dividends or weighted voting.
 * In naive implementations it's possible to perform a "double spend" attack by reusing the same balance from different
 * accounts. By using snapshots to calculate dividends or voting power, those attacks no longer apply. It can also be
 * used to create an efficient ERC20 forking mechanism.
 *
 * Snapshots are created by the internal {_snapshot} function, which will emit the {Snapshot} event and return a
 * snapshot id. To get the total supply at the time of a snapshot, call the function {totalSupplyAt} with the snapshot
 * id. To get the balance of an account at the time of a snapshot, call the {balanceOfAt} function with the snapshot id
 * and the account address.
 *
 * NOTE: Snapshot policy can be customized by overriding the {_getCurrentSnapshotId} method. For example, having it
 * return `block.number` will trigger the creation of snapshot at the beginning of each new block. When overriding this
 * function, be careful about the monotonicity of its result. Non-monotonic snapshot ids will break the contract.
 *
 * Implementing snapshots for every block using this method will incur significant gas costs. For a gas-efficient
 * alternative consider {ERC20Votes}.
 *
 * ==== Gas Costs
 *
 * Snapshots are efficient. Snapshot creation is _O(1)_. Retrieval of balances or total supply from a snapshot is _O(log
 * n)_ in the number of snapshots that have been created, although _n_ for a specific account will generally be much
 * smaller since identical balances in subsequent snapshots are stored as a single entry.
 *
 * There is a constant overhead for normal ERC20 transfers due to the additional snapshot bookkeeping. This overhead is
 * only significant for the first transfer that immediately follows a snapshot for a particular account. Subsequent
 * transfers will have normal cost until the next snapshot, and so on.

     * @dev Attributes are defined as bit mask, with the bit position encoding it's meaning and the bit's value whether this attribute is attested or not.
     *    Example:
     *    - position 0: 1 = has been KYCed (0 = not KYCed)
     *    - position 1: 1 = is american citizen (0 = not american citizen)
     *    - position 2: 1 = is a penguin (0 = not a penguin)
     *    These meanings are not defined within code, neither in the token contract nor the allowList. Nevertheless, the definition used by the people responsible for both contracts MUST match,
     *    or the token contract will not work as expected. E.g. if the allowList defines position 2 as "is a penguin", while the token contract uses position 2 as "is a hedgehog", then the tokens
     *    might be sold to hedgehogs, which was never the intention.
     *    Here some examples of how requirements can be used in practice:
     *    value 0b0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000101, means "is KYCed and is a penguin"
     *    value 0b0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000111, means "is KYCed, is american and is a penguin"
     *    value 0b0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000, means "has not proven any relevant attributes to the allowList operator" (default value)
     *
     *    The highest four bits are defined as tiers as follows (depicted with less bits because 256 is a lot):
     *    - 0b0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 = tier 0
     *    - 0b0001000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 = tier 1
     *    - 0b0011000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 = tier 2 (and 1)
     *    - 0b0111000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 = tier 3 (and 2 and 1)
     *    - 0b1111000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 = tier 4 (and 3 and 2 and 1)
     *    This very simple definition allows for a maximum of 5 tiers, even though 4 bits are used for encoding. By sacrificing some space it can be implemented without code changes.

/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```solidity
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]

/**
 * @dev Interface of the ERC20 Permit extension allowing approvals to be made via signatures, as defined in
 * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612[EIP-2612].
 *
 * Adds the {permit} method, which can be used to change an account's ERC20 allowance (see {IERC20-allowance}) by
 * presenting a message signed by the account. By not relying on {IERC20-approve}, the token holder account doesn't
 * need to send a transaction, and thus is not required to hold Ether at all.
 *
 * ==== Security Considerations
 *
 * There are two important considerations concerning the use of `permit`. The first is that a valid permit signature
 * expresses an allowance, and it should not be assumed to convey additional meaning. In particular, it should not be
 * considered as an intention to spend the allowance in any specific way. The second is that because permits have
 * built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun. A protocol that uses permits should
 * take this into consideration and allow a `permit` call to fail. Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be
 * generally recommended is:
 *
 * ```solidity
 * function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {
 *     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}
 *     doThing(..., value);
 * }
 *
 * function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {
 *     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);
 *     ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of
 * `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also
 * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).
 *
 * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so
 * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.

 * they need in their contracts using a combination of `abi.encode` and `keccak256`.

 * ({_hashTypedDataV4}).
 *
 * The implementation of the domain separator was designed to be as efficient as possible while still properly updating
 * the chain id to protect against replay attacks on an eventual fork of the chain.
 *
 * NOTE: This contract implements the version of the encoding known as "v4", as implemented by the JSON RPC method
 * https://docs.metamask.io/guide/signing-data.html[`eth_signTypedDataV4` in MetaMask].
 *
 * NOTE: In the upgradeable version of this contract, the cached values will correspond to the address, and the domain

 * separator from the immutable values, which is cheaper than accessing a cached version in cold storage.
