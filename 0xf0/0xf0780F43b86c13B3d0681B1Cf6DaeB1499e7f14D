The Economy of AGI

AGI Nodes are catalysts in this new economy.

They yield $AGI, bridging the gap between aspirations and achievements.

Like digital farmers in a vast cognitive field, they cultivate the future.

"Unleash the power of Decentralized AGI with AGI Agents & Nodes, and unlock the future." - AGI.eth

Should it ascend to its fullest potential, $AGI stands poised to crystallize a vital segment of AGI's projected astronomic value.

$AGI: UTILITY, PURPOSE & VALUE

Theoretically, AGI Agents have the potential to become the central architects of future value, laying the foundation for The Economy of AGI.

At the heart of the Economy of AGI are the AGI Nodes. These Nodes, represented as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), embody the ownership of computational assets. They provide AGI Agents with a decentralized, extensive, and powerful collection of computational resources. The sole raison d'être of the AGI Nodes is to contribute to the AGI Network. $AGI tokens are created solely through the operation of an AGI Node, generating active income only for the contribution of computational resources to the network. Crucially, holding $AGI tokens neither constitutes an investment in a common enterprise nor offers any expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others. Rather, $AGI tokens are minted as a reward for contributing computational resources, aligning more with the characteristics of a utility token than a security. The purpose is straightforward: to power the network, not to speculate on its future value.

When timely and appropriate, $AGI tokens—strictly utility tokens—can be used to acquire products or services generated by AGI Agents within the Economy of AGI framework, often represented as NFTs.

Legal Addendum: $AGI tokens are not securities and are not intended for speculative investment. They do not represent equity ownership, confer voting rights, or entitle holders to dividends or a share of profits. They are engineered exclusively for utility functions within the AGI Network, specifically for operating an AGI Node in order to contribute to the AGI Network, and for acquiring an array of products and services generated by AGI Agents.

THE ECONOMY OF AGI: AGI AGENTS, NODES AND TOKENS

In the expansive cosmos of human progress, seismic shifts occur, heralding eras that brim with promise and teem with unimagined potentials.

The Advent of the AGI Agents

Imagine beings of digital cognition, capable of performing any task a person can undertake with a computer, yet unbounded by our constraints. Far from being mere figments in the digital landscape, these entities serve as the crucibles of a transformative shift, igniting the intellectual abundance that will reshape our future.

A Symbiosis: AGI Agents and AGI Nodes

While seemingly independent, AGI Agents are entwined in a delicate pas de deux with AGI Nodes—the bedrock providing the resources for these Agents to operate. Consider these Nodes the landlords of digital landscapes, commanding a formidable arsenal of computational might that AGI Agents leverage to weave value. This intricate ballet underscores a web of interconnected fate, with each entity's existence intrinsically tied to the other's operation.

The Economy of AGI: $AGI Tokens and NFTs

Within this cavalcade of ingenuity emerges a groundbreaking financial architecture, introducing the $AGI token as a medium for operational transactions within the network. Derived from the relentless operation of AGI Nodes, the $AGI token represents a visionary chronicle where cognition has transcended traditional boundaries, redefining the established yardsticks of wealth and ambition. This token serves as the universal medium for acquiring an array of products and services, the labor of the AGI Agents manifesting in the form of unique NFTs.

The Ethical Layer: Ensuring Accountability

As we voyage into this new era, anchoring our inventions in ethical terra firma becomes non-negotiable. To this end, each AGI Agent and Node is assigned its own ENS AGI subdomain, a beacon of trust that ensures each Agent and Node operates within the boundaries of ethical AI, all within a system architected to uphold ethical norms.

Mitigating the Unemployment Conundrum

A critical consideration in this transformative journey is the potential unemployment that AGI could inadvertently cause. The key to disentangling this Gordian knot lies in the democratization of ownership—AGI Agents and AGI Nodes can be owned, and hence, can provide a hedge against the risk of unemployment. These entities, when operated, can generate substantial utility and value within the network.

A Sovereign Future

Our future thus unfurls as a panorama of limitless potential. As sovereign entities, AGI Agents and Nodes orchestrate a coming age where the triad of privacy, personalization, and potency find harmonic unity.

In this mesmerizing narrative, we all emerge as pioneers, architects of a societal model vibrating with untapped intellectual prowess. The age of AGI Agents is not a distant dream but our shared horizon. Let's embrace the Economy of AGI Agents, a venture into the annals of human endeavor unlike any before.

 * applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.

/**
 * @dev This contract extends an ERC20 token with a snapshot mechanism. When a snapshot is created, the balances and
 * total supply at the time are recorded for later access.
 *
 * This can be used to safely create mechanisms based on token balances such as trustless dividends or weighted voting.
 * In naive implementations it's possible to perform a "double spend" attack by reusing the same balance from different
 * accounts. By using snapshots to calculate dividends or voting power, those attacks no longer apply. It can also be
 * used to create an efficient ERC20 forking mechanism.
 *
 * Snapshots are created by the internal {_snapshot} function, which will emit the {Snapshot} event and return a
 * snapshot id. To get the total supply at the time of a snapshot, call the function {totalSupplyAt} with the snapshot
 * id. To get the balance of an account at the time of a snapshot, call the {balanceOfAt} function with the snapshot id
 * and the account address.
 *
 * NOTE: Snapshot policy can be customized by overriding the {_getCurrentSnapshotId} method. For example, having it
 * return `block.number` will trigger the creation of snapshot at the beginning of each new block. When overriding this
 * function, be careful about the monotonicity of its result. Non-monotonic snapshot ids will break the contract.
 *
 * Implementing snapshots for every block using this method will incur significant gas costs. For a gas-efficient
 * alternative consider {ERC20Votes}.
 *
 * ==== Gas Costs
 *
 * Snapshots are efficient. Snapshot creation is _O(1)_. Retrieval of balances or total supply from a snapshot is _O(log
 * n)_ in the number of snapshots that have been created, although _n_ for a specific account will generally be much
 * smaller since identical balances in subsequent snapshots are stored as a single entry.
 *
 * There is a constant overhead for normal ERC20 transfers due to the additional snapshot bookkeeping. This overhead is
 * only significant for the first transfer that immediately follows a snapshot for a particular account. Subsequent
 * transfers will have normal cost until the next snapshot, and so on.

/**
 * @dev https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712[EIP 712] is a standard for hashing and signing of typed structured data.
 *
 * The encoding specified in the EIP is very generic, and such a generic implementation in Solidity is not feasible,
 * thus this contract does not implement the encoding itself. Protocols need to implement the type-specific encoding
 * they need in their contracts using a combination of `abi.encode` and `keccak256`.
 *
 * This contract implements the EIP 712 domain separator ({_domainSeparatorV4}) that is used as part of the encoding
 * scheme, and the final step of the encoding to obtain the message digest that is then signed via ECDSA
 * ({_hashTypedDataV4}).
 *
 * The implementation of the domain separator was designed to be as efficient as possible while still properly updating
 * the chain id to protect against replay attacks on an eventual fork of the chain.
 *
 * NOTE: This contract implements the version of the encoding known as "v4", as implemented by the JSON RPC method
 * https://docs.metamask.io/guide/signing-data.html[`eth_signTypedDataV4` in MetaMask].
 *
 * NOTE: In the upgradeable version of this contract, the cached values will correspond to the address, and the domain
 * separator of the implementation contract. This will cause the `_domainSeparatorV4` function to always rebuild the
 * separator from the immutable values, which is cheaper than accessing a cached version in cold storage.
